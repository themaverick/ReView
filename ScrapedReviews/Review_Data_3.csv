41,Low writing speed compare to other brands on same price,3,Low writing speed compare to other brands on same price. Big in size. Not easy to use. Plastic casing makes issue while inserting.
42,Don't buy for USB 3.2..,2,"I bought this flash drive because I needed a decent storage capacity and a fast transfer speed. I was attracted by the sleek design and the USB 3.2 specification. However, I was very disappointed by the actual performance of this product.
The write speed of this flash drive is only 10 MB/s, which is much slower than other devices in its class. It took me a long time to copy large files to this drive. The read speed is 100 MB/s, which is decent but not impressive. I expected more from a USB 3.2 device.
The plastic body of this flash drive feels cheap and fragile. It does not have a cap or a cover to protect the connector. The sliding mechanism is not smooth and sometimes gets stuck. The integrated key loop is too small and flimsy to attach to anything securely.
The only positive thing about this flash drive is that it's black color and a simple design. However, that does not make up for the poor performance and quality. I would not recommend this product to anyone who needs a fast and reliable flash drive.
A possible use for this drive is to create a multiboot USB drive or a software/APK repository for your system experiments. Only time will tell the reliability of this drive.
This flash drive is not worth the price and does not live up to the claims of the manufacturer. It is a waste of money and time. I regret buying it and I wish I could return it."
43,Very good product at this price range ....,4,Good product..... On product it mension that 70MB/s. Speed but it's work on 20-30 MB/s and it's sufficient. But it is good and worth it at this price...
