2,Comfortable and Versatile Crop Top!,5,"I recently bought the Jockey Women's 1582 Super Combed Regular Cotton Elastane Stretch Slip-On Crop Top, and it's quickly become a favorite in my wardrobe. The cotton-elastane blend makes it super comfortable and stretchy, providing a snug fit without feeling tight. It‚Äôs perfect for lounging at home or wearing under sheer tops for extra coverage.
The slip-on design is convenient and the fabric feels soft against the skin. If you're looking for a versatile crop top that's both comfy and stylish, this one is a great choice!"

10,Image is deceptive it's not pack of 2,2,With two models displayed in the product image it reflects that it's a pack of two. However don't get fooled by the image. It's pack of 1.

It is a okay kind of product."
29,Worst,1,Worst
30,It's not meant for support..The elastic band is too thin to support.,4,Ok
31,Received used product,1,
32,Packaging is not good,1,I like the product but not packaging
33,very small for size large,4,"im not a fat person (1,6m 58 kg) and i dont have a huge bust either. but i ordered size large because of the other reviws saying that the bra is smaller than its size. i should have actually ordered an xl because i still find it tight and it restricts my breathing. but i have to say that i didnt buy it specifically for sports, but that i bought it for every day wear. i will keep it hoping that the elastic strap that makes it so tight will eventually get looser. the colour is beautiful and the quality seems to be good too. its 97% cotton 3% spandex"
34,Price is high,3,"Product is ok, nice soft.
But price is higher"
35,Best Product,5,I would definitely recommend this product for daily use as it is quite comfortable to wear and the material used is also of very good quality.
36,It's good. Go for it as per your  needs from 'an inner' thing.,3,"It's  good... the cloth  material... also top or shirts goes well on this even outdoors. But.. I don't  know why it hurts my shoulders  after wearing for few hours.  Maybe it would be designed for yoga,  sports  thing... not for daily use would be the reson for this little  heaviness  on my shoulder. It would be best if designed in round shape from back..."
37,Jockey women's,4,"I purchased this to wear at home rather then wearing the tight ones. It's a good fit, soft, very comfortable however the material is a bit itchy, when I say bit - it means just at the beginning of wearing it for 2 - 3 times. It's better to wear such comfortable bras then the tight strap ones. It's not that expensive too."
38,Good product at this price,4,"Good product, but after reading the reviews i ordered 2 size larger, so i had to replace 1 of 2 bras, because i had used one for trial and i didn't want to return the used one. Go fir 1 size larger of your actual size otherwise bra is good for daily wear when have to stay at home all day"
39,Comfortable,5,Very comfortable
40,Comfortable for first experience,4,"This is a repeat purchase.
My daughter was introduced to life with bra, 7 months back. She did not have any issue with this. It was comfortable and fit perfectly well.
Rated 4 because I expect durability to be more than 7 months."
41,Order size as per the chart shared by others in review,3,"I got a different color than what I had ordered which isn't such a big issue for me but it doesn't provide much support. Material is soft and comfortable to wear at home but cant wear outside. So if you're looking for proper sport bra, this isn't one but if you're looking for something comfortable to wear at home instead of a bra, this is good."
42,Very bad,1,Use product given
43,Not good.,3,The size is too small.  Not very comfortable.
44,Comfartable,3,"Very light, Must have"
45,Its rubber starts to get worse after 1 month,1,The product at first is decent but if you wear it 4 or 5 times the rubber get loosened and it's not comfortable anymore.
46,Bestüòä,5,"One of the cheapest yet value for money product from jockey. This product is made for comfort  and 24√ó7 use. You can blindly use it for a long day of work outside or as a lounge wear. Girls who favours comfort over anything, should go for it. And dont be deceived by its low price, it is genuinely one of the best product of jockey. Girls who are in their adolescence and want some support can start with this crop top before going for bras. There are other sports bras in the market in the higher price segment, but most of them are for sports purposes with padding but this is the only one which you can use for ultimate comfortüòä"
47,Good,4,Good
48,Comfortable,5,It is really good and provide a comfy feeling üôÇ..
49,It is comfortable,4,The fabric of this bra is very soft
50,Not for heavy bust!,3,Girls with heavy bust might not feel comfortable in this. Also the waist band elastic makes my skin itchy. The cloth is fine!
51,Avarage product,3,Avarage
52,Okay,3,Okay
53,Super comfortable,4,Value for money 100% sure
54,Not comfortable. Disappointed by Jockey!!,3,"This product, being from the house of Jockey, disappointed me quite to an extent. The fabric is soft but the elastic sits tight on your skin. The fit is good and matches with their standard size chart. I found it not very comfortable as after wearing for a while it gets itchy and tight at the underbust. I would definitely prefer a similar product of Enamor which gives way more comfort than this."
55,I can breathe in it,5,"I was skeptical when I got this. It definitely wasn't my size I thought. But when I tried, it was seamless. There's no flab coming out. It's not tight.. it's just perfect. I'm so glad. I've never given a review on clothes in my life. But this gave me joy that I ran to the review section to give it a feedback. After years of ill fit bras, nothing made me this happy. ""I can breathe in it"""
56,Good,4,Good product but it is not available on jockey shop
57,Unsuitable,3,It‚Äôs design is faulty. It is visible to others when you dress up with saree and blouse. Hence it‚Äôs demerit weighs higher than its merit. It is soft but unsuitable for a party wear with small dresses. It requires full coverage of the body to remain invisible
58,Amazing,5,It is extremely comfortable but it won't eliminate the bounce for girls with heavy burst but you can wear it at home.
59,To good,5,The quality is great but remember to order your perfect size cuz it has elastic which pinches.A very decent price
60,Comfortable,5,
61,Wrong size chart,3,"The product is smaller than expected,i think it is for girls not women. I attached the size chart given with the product. Size M fits 30inch bust according to the size chart but the sticker on product says 85cm ie, 34 inch. If your size is 34, go for XL."
62,Good product,4,"Good product.
The only drawback is we're compelled to buy 2 nos. at one go. Can not buy 1 piece alone.
Also, the elastic at the bottom of the inner wear is thin, which causes inconvenience if you wear for a longtime. If Jockey can take this advice of increasing the width of the elastic by 2 inches. Then this will be too good."
63,Aswsome,5,It is very comfortable and light weight go for it
64,Kind of Comfortable,4,It's not the original jockey but it's good and comfortable with elastic all over the edges. My size is between 32B-34A
65,Highly recommended,5,"Good quality
Best price
Fit is exact"
66,Can be bit thik otherwise good one,4,This product fits very good and even comfortable as well considering the softness this is very good but it could have bit thik as it looks like it can torn anytime if get streched a bit.
67,Too tight!,3,"If you will ask me about this product, I'd say...it was too tight. I really can't breathe while wearing this cotton top ..and I ordered it of my size but I don't know why is it too tight...! Its simply a cotton top without cups or anything."
68,Nice,5,Nice
69,size information for the product is not appropriate,1,"Selected the wrong item due to wrong information on the website. This type of poor information sharing is not expected from Jockey or Amazon. In the size chart, size M is mentioned as 33-35 inches and on the product, size M is mentioned as 73-77 cm. This way, the customer will never be able to select the right size product!"
70,Amazing product,5,Comfortable and affordable
71,Nice,4,My daughter is happy
72,...,4,Material is good but size is smaller than usual one. If you wear xs size then order small one otherwise it will be too tight.
73,"Quality was good, worth for money",5,"Quality was good, worth for money packing was not good completely opened , plz maintain neet packing"
74,Good one. Go for it.,4,I ordered a xl size but it seems loose so you should order one size less than your usual size. After all product is good. I am using it. Very comfortable.
75,Pathetic product,1,Totally different from whatever you r showing in site poor quality of fabric  stiching and size is too small whatever u r giving in size chart . It u try to wear it it will torn . Looks like it's been used product . I want to return it. Total waste of money.  It even too small u can't wear it
76,Value for money,4,Perfect fit just check inches and size will totally fits you. Comfortable to wear all day and gives you very light hold not meant for heavy jumping exercise.
77,It's good as market price it's 319 or 419 but here we get it in256,4,Like it
78,Non padded,3,It's non padded one
79,so so,4,"fitting is ok, but built is not good. causes shoulder pain sometimes due to being too naggy on the shoulders.."
80,Very comfertable and soft.,5,Thanks to seller for accepting replacement and send me the requested size
81,Great product,5,It's really goood.. Go for it
82,Size not true ; XL feels like L ; for an XL size I feel should have gone for XXL,3,Cloth quality good but size is small for an XL size ; it fits small hence not at all comfortable to wear . I‚Äôm disappointed
83,Comfortable,5,True to size
84,Gud,5,Gud
85,Good Quality,4,Quality of product is good. Jockey can be a bit more generous with their sizes
86,"Best buy as beginner, house/wear.",5,"Genuine Jockey brand doesn't need any review.
I bought this for my daughter who is in love with cotton top. With other brand  she has used she always complained about irritation of elastic and comfort. She is happy with this so am I.
Must buy product as beginner or house/night wearing."
87,Snug and Perfect,5,"It's perfect. It's not small like some of the other buyers have mentioned. Quite the same like the same product I've bought from a local dealer of Jockey before. Although the price is a too much than the retail price. Overall, the product is great. Snug, soft, comfy, and supports well."
88,Comfortable,5,"Purchased this item to wear at home ...the material is real soft and fits really well..absolute value for money...after entire day of wearing bra at office , when randomly someone comes to visit in the evening ,you can just slip into these...feels good..."
89,Fits one size larger than the size chart indicates,3,This product is just short of great. The size is inaccurate. Unfortunately one only realised how bad it was when the Enamour equivalent came and that was ‚ô•Ô∏è
90,Not the coorect fit,4,After reading the reviews I ordered a size xl even though the normal size I use was 36.It was a bit large.I think L would have been correct size.Apart from this the product is as described and as shown in the images.
91,Good quality lounge wear,5,Good quality lounge wear
92,Size chart shown is wrong in the website,3,Would be better to order one size bigger if you're plus size and not sure about the chart.
93,If you are medium order XL,4,"Comfy
XL is 32""chest"
94,Good,5,Good
95,Good,4,It's good
96,Size,2,Napasand
97,Best,4,Compared to enomour it was cheap nd best...nd it was two layered thick fabric...perfect for nightwear...
98,Rubber is not upto the mark ....,3,Fabris is superb ... comfort is also good ....but rubber is of bad quality  ..
99,Comfortable and useful,4,"Its good to wear it and very comfortable.
You can use it for 2 or 3 months without losing its elasticity
I recommend every lady to buy it"
