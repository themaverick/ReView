0,"Premium phone at budget price, loved it",5,"Points to know before buying, got it for 17k:
1. Ui and updates 4.5/5, it's smooth and responsive no complains
2. Camera 4.6/5, comparable with Samsung midrange phones
3. Battery 4.2/5, I charge my phone upto 80% It takes around 45 min for it. The charge consumption is a little on the higher side
4. Design 4.5/5, I bought the gray colour phone. It looks premium to me, fun fact its the same color as my macbook. Reviewers are saying it's havy, but I haven't felt it, it's comfortable on the hand
5. Screen 4.1/5, the only reason I gave it a low score is its comparatively thicker bezels. Samsung tried to make the bezels symmetrical, but still the chin is slightly thicker. Other things are good, outdoor brightness is good, easily visible.
6. Sensors and features 4.7/5, It got all the Samsung flagship features like Knox, nfc, dual speakers, it will fill like a premium phone
7. Processor 4/5, for daily usages, its good also can handle havy task. App opening is fast, handle animations as a pro, no lags at all. But not made for long gaming sessions. It will throttle after 1 hr gaming. But at this budget I liked the Processor
Special mention, the speakers are really great, ram management is good and one con is it does not have a ip rating"
1,Best 16k phone,5,"Absolute value for money mobile phone. Snappy interface, monstrous battery(Screenshot attached - Without SIM). Good set of cameras. Clean One UI. Samsung wallet feature. Good in hand feel."
2,"Overall very good phone, 25w is -ve comapred to competitors.",4,"Everything about this phone is great: the display, camera, speed, and battery life. The only drawback is the slow charging speed it charges at 25W, which is quite low compared to the competition, as even phones priced at 10,000 INR now feature 33W fast charging. If this isn't an issue for you, go for it. Another minor downside is that it's a bit large and heavy at 222 grams."
3,Great product with great deal,5,Bought it with exchange offer during prime day sell. Performance is good. Mainly using it for listening to music. Audio quality is good. Camera is also decent. Feels bulky and sturdy. Battery backup is just awesome. Call quality is also good wherein if you put call over speaker voice is crystal clear. Just go for it....
4,Display and sound is superb. Camera is just average,3,Display is best as usual for samsung phones. Sound is also  good as it supports Dolby Atmos. I am somewhat disappointed with the camera. My galaxy M31 shoots far better photos than this M35. Details are missing in photos. Phone is also too heavy to be managed by one hand effortlessly. But the One UI is the best and the most user friendly UI.
5,Really solid performer at this price point,5,"There are many phones available at this price range, it's really confusing which one to buy üòï
Had my eyes on OnePlus nord 3 as it was selling at 19k few days back ....but changed my mind after getting reminded about the infamous green line issue of OnePlus devicesüòÇ then I was about to buy iqoo z9, but was a bit skeptical about it as a Chinese brand and bloatware filled, spyware filled crappy software, then this phone launched at 18th july and went on sale on 20th july, bought it at the first sale...got a generous discount on the mrp!! I bought the 8gb ram 128gb storage model at only ‚Çπ11972 after bank discount+ coupon discount+ promo code+ exchanged an 3 year old 4g phone of mine, think it was a pretty good deal.
Pros: great performance, no lag or jitters
Network reception, no complaints.. greatly exploiting unlimited jio 5g üòÇ getting upto 1gbps of speeds!
Display - 120hz sAmoled panel,uniform bezels [bit thick but feels really premium because they are uniform] no problems here too..my previous phone was also 120hz amoled , but this phone feels way smoother and well optimized ‚ù§Ô∏è
Cameras- again blown away by the results!
Way better than my previous phone which had 108mp cameraü§∑üèª, probably the best camera till date on a M series samsung phone
Comparable to A series.
Battery backup: excellent üëåüèª getting around 12 hours of SOT on light to medium usage
Charging speed: 0 to 100% in less than 2 [using original 25w samsung charger] hours, it's fine for me as i charge using a 10w charger which won't degrade the battery as soon.
Cons: bit heavy but fine...got used to it in just 2-3 days,
Plastic back panel: missing my old redmi note 10 pro max as it had a beautiful frosted curved glass back ü•≤[obviously better than this]
No 3.5 mm headphone jack!! Despite being so thick it doesn't have the headphone jack
Had to buy a type c to 3.5 mm DAC @ ‚Çπ209 ü§∑üèª yes i still use wired earphones [JBL and Sony] they sound way better than wired ones and have no latency üåü"
6,Amazing,5,"It's works just as they advertised it .
THE DISPLAY is really good , after all it's a SAMSUNG OLED panel , the colour and viewing angles are astonishing .
THE SOUND is crisp it's not too loud , it's on the comforting side but it is very crisp and it has DOLBY ATMOS support for compatible songs and videos too .
THE PERFORMANCE is very good at this price point , it's not a gaming phone you have to keep that in mind it's an all-around balanced phone that checks all the boxes ... in that sense day to usage the performance is really good and heating isn't an issue the vapour chamber does work well . It keeps the phone cool , however you can absolutely do light gaming on it ... performance is very stable and it doesn't throttle at all .
THE CAMERA is good it takes sharp and detailed images in good conditions and even in low lights the shots are decent ... The colour science on all the 3 cameras (excluding the macro lens) is very consistent . Shots taken are good , portrait mode has decent edge detection . Pictures are vivid and punchy coloured (as expected from SAMSUNG tuning)... Selfie are crisp too skin is almost perfect as the vivids the tones a bit .
THE BATTERY is big changes grade , you can't kill the phone even if you use it all day ... even on heavy usage the phone lasted about a bit short of 1.5 days for me . The charging is capped to 25w but you have to buy the charger separately... but charging speed is fine . No complains on that .
THE BUILD is really good , yes it is plastic frame with acrylic back but it's sturdy af ... front is Corning's Victus+ that's the same on from my Galaxy S22 , it has tougher Crack resistance but it can scratch , so I recommend using a protector film or glass .
Overall the experience is reallllly good for the price I paid for it (‚Çπ18499 for 8 ,128GB variant) I will highly recommend this if you want an all-around balanced phone ."
7,Love the samsung brand,5,Samaung brand is everything for phones and tv. M35 is handy phone inspite of its size and weight. Display is good. Camera is good. Battery performance is good. I have been using m30s for 5 years. I loved it. Thats why i go with M series. M35 is perfect choice. Go for it.
8,Decent product according  to 16k price,3,"Battery backup  n super amoled screen could hv been better!
Charging speed is slow plus battery  consumption  is more even with  day to day activity
Even though  screen is super amoled  it feels like some cheap  blurry screen specially  when consuming youtube or netflix
Camera is okay performance  is okay
Disappointed  with samsung as samsung doesn't  provide charger along with this product in india( launched in other countries  with charger ,thn why so partial )
Dont spend 18k on such device, upto 16k  device is fine"
9,"Very good display, connectivity, no heating",4,"This phone is very good first time before purchasing i was thinking about heat and lags, but after buying I've not seen those. Battery backup purpouse i bouth it, writing from this mobile also. Battery is little bit disappointing, it should go atleast 1.5 days.
I'm not a heavy user
Only wp for work purpose and sometime youtube for entertainment.
I've samsung m14 this battery backup is more than it. THAT'S why I can compare those.
If in future samsung upgrade it's battery backup through software then I'll give 5*.
The phone is very good from every side and I like heavy mobiles it feels solid."
10,So far so good,5,"Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.
Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.
Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.
If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.
I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.
They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.
Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.
For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens."
11,"Excellent Camera and Display, but Buggy Apps Hold it Back",4,"Here's a review:
Rating: 4/5
I've been using the M35 for a few weeks now, and I must say, the camera and display are truly exceptional. The camera captures stunning images with great detail and color accuracy, making it perfect for photography enthusiasts. The display is vibrant and crisp, with great viewing angles and brightness.
However, my experience with the M35 has been somewhat marred by the presence of bloatware apps that can't be uninstalled. These apps not only take up valuable storage space but also slow down the phone's performance. I've noticed occasional lag and freezing issues, which can be frustrating.
If the manufacturer could streamline the software and remove the unnecessary apps, the M35 would be a nearly flawless device. As it stands, it's still a great option for those who prioritize camera quality and display, but may not be the best choice for those seeking a seamless, bloat-free experience.
Pros:
- Excellent camera performance
- Vibrant and crisp display
- Good battery life
Cons:
- Bloatware apps slow down performance
- Occasional lag and freezing issues
- No option to uninstall unwanted apps"
12,Great phone with one defect,4,"I liked the phone overall. Camera is great at this price, battery is great, display is good too. Bit heavy, I would suggest to use think cover. I found one defect that the front camera lens and circular notch are not aligned. I raised the issue to Amazon and next day they provided me replacement, but I got the same defect in other piece as well. I observed in many ways, but I still see the offset. Small issue but it doesn't affect the performance of this phone."
13,Decent performance and battery life,4,"IMPORTANT: For those who need it, there is no 3.5 mm jack on this phone. I noticed it after receiving but as we use bluetooth headphones, it was not a dealbreaker.
Got it for 17k during the sale. Though it shows 16k on the product page, the process of cashback of 1k as amazon pay balance is not clear.
Had ordered this for kid. So usage profile is mostly school apps, youtube, google meet, roblox etc. Not used for gaming much so heating etc is not faced yet. Battery life is awesome (3+ days) with mild usage (2-3 hrs screen time per day).
I use this phone for tracking kid's location to/from classes so location sharing is always on.
Camera is barely used by us and seems ok at this pricepoint.
5G connectivity (checked only with vodafone) is good. Voice is clear during calls without the need of wifi calling setting.
Will update if i find anything annoying/bad. As of now its a decent phone at a slightly higher price point."
14,Customization at its best... üî•üî•,4,"1. The software experience is amazing.
2. Phone is fast enough for normal usage.
3. It takes 1hr 40 mins to charge fully. I've no problem about it. It's okay.
4. Camera is okay for normal usage.
5. The thing I miss in One UI is app lock. üò¢
6. I was expecting a slimmer phone. It disappoints me here.
7. Samsung please make compact phone under 20K. Please. üôè"
15,Best phone if you're buying with offers,4,"5 ‚≠ê any day, the phone is great, the display is similar to the one used in iPhones. the battery lasts for a day unlike other brands smartphone. 5G reception is great too and the software is lag free. it's everything one could ask for in 15,999 !!
Only gave it 4 stars because of the shipping issues i faced. I ordered on 19th and i received the phone on 26th."
16,Samsung M35,4,"I purchased the phone on the launch, good phone at 16,999 price. Camera 5/5, performance 5/5, design & build quality 5/5, clean Stock Android, I noticed when phone is on 5g network battery will drain fast, so samsung need to fix it, battery I am not sure - optimization required, Heating issues too.
overall good phone in fact balanced phone."
17,M 35 5 G,4,"It's value for money phone.Camera, processor output as per expectations. Little bit Heating issue."
18,Chaging is very slow,4,"Charger not provided with this phone. Only cable and using any other 25 watt adapter, it takes almost 2hrs to complete charge.
At least recommend  which adapter is acceptable?"
19,Satisfied,4,Good for normal use. Selfie camera is below average.
20,Velu for money,4,"Best samsung mobail , hardware and software"
21,Valu for money,4,"All over performance is too good.
Only weight is the issue.
Such a gem"
22,Value for money,4,Overall performance good
23,Decent phone,4,"YouTube 2160 60fps is not supported in this device.
Device is bulky and heavy"
24,Average phone,4,Go for display and samsung one ui software. Camera is average. Phone has more weight.
25,best budget phone till now from sumsung,5,just go for it if you want it for normal usage/business use. overall balanced phone with loads of useful features  plus good software support /experience and made in India! {not for heavy gaming bros}people complaining about weight but after few days you wont notice the weight. 25w charging might be and issue for some but for me i put it to charge at night also slow charging is good for battery health! processor is not for heavy gaming. casual is fine. go for 8 gb ram if you wont to use it for long term! the main purpose i bought this phone cause of Samsung's ui . most of these Chinese phones provide many great specs for cheap price but they don't focus on software experience . having great specs without stable software is a n horrible experience and don't let the device to work at its full potential.
26,Almost Paisa Vasool phone,5,"i got my phone on 21st July 2024 Samsung Galaxy M35 5G , 6GB & 128 GB (DayBreak Blue).
After using my phone for 5 days i m writing this review..
This is a great value for money phone.
The screen is fluid ,punchy and razor sharp with good brightness even in outdoor (past few days there is no harsh sunlight so can‚Äôt get that perspective).
Screen refresh rate is nice as it delivers 120Hz speedy screen.
Call quality and Network reception is also good.
Battery backup is good.
You can do gaming upto 60Hz though not a gaming phone.
Widevine L1 support is available so the Netflix , amazon prime video and other streaming apps worked fine and because the phone also has Dolby Atmos support the sound got better and crisp.
it‚Äôs a value preposition even i got a security patch update yesterday.
i will highly recommend you all if any one is there to do a Smartbuying cause it has all the features that are there in Samsung Galaxy A35 5G  in a price less than 7k . i recommend this phone to everyone except Gamers ."
27,Fabulous Mobile in Budget Price,5,"I bought this mobile for my father and he was so happy to get this mobile. I am pointing out some major things about this mobile.
1) Camera - Good in this budget price. It has Sony sensor so capturing good quality photos. 4/5
2) Display - Super Amoled with 120Hz refresh rarte so no doubt it's good. 5/5
3) Speakers - Dolby on Speakers is excellent. Loud and crispy sound quality. 5/5
4) Heating - Little bit of heating issue is there but it's negligible. 4/5
5) Call Quality - Call quality is excellent as it has a dedicated voice focus feature. 5/5
6) Call Recoding - Obviously call Recoding feature is available. 5/5
7) Software update - It has 4 years of OS update and 5 Years of Security Patch updates which is excellent in this budget mobile. 5/5
8) Fingerprint - I mostly like Physical Fingerprint rather than In display. Depends on you choice. It's working perfectly and very much sensitive. 5/5
9) Battery - It has 6000 mAh gigantic Battery last longer for 1 and half day midum of usage. 5/5
10) Performance - Exynos 1380 4nm processor Performance really surprised me. It can handle havy tasks easily so no doubt but remember this is not a gaming processor or mobile. 4.5/5
11) Others - It has a dedicated vapour cooling chamber so the generated heat from the processor distributed to the whole surface to cool the mobile faster. 5/5
Overall this budget mobile is absolutely fabulous mobile from samsung."
28,Good phone under 20k,5,"Overall a very good phone. Bought for my mom & she
is happy with the performance. Screen & build quality is also good. Battery backup last easily for 1.5 days for moderate user.
Dual speakers are load clear & great. Camera is also good with all basic & fun features. Connectivity also no issues found. All sensors available.
Good upgrade compared to M34. Definitely can consider under 18k. Samsung good job."
29,value for money purchase,5,"bought this for my mother , got the 256 gb version for 19 k during sale, the device is sturdy, battery backup is easily 1.5 days, camera images quite good for a device at this range, sharp voice output, vivid display. heating issue is minor its better if you dont play games on this. device will definitely last a person more than 3 years. keep the display 60 hz to prevent battery drain."
30,Great deal üëå,5,"It works amazingly great. Love the finish even though has a plastic back ,but gives a premium vibe Wille holding . Overall phone and specs are good but I found some bugs here and there (as it is freshly launched) , but will surely get fixed in the upcoming updates by Samsung"

It feel hot when you use phone during charging .
Overall nice phone 4.2/5."
32,Mixed feelings...,3,"This mobile's battery performance is disappointing, as it drains quickly. My previous Vivo V21 had excellent battery life. Additionally, this mobile heats up during normal activities like watching YouTube videos. On the positive side, the camera quality is decent for the price, and the display is bright and vibrant. However, the phone is quite heavy. Should have gone for Motorola Edge 50 Neo or Pro"
33,At last punch hole display in budget from Samsung,5,"Display, camera, processor, speakers, network all things are as per Samsung standards. It has NFC so can use samsung wallet for payment. Totally value for money if u can get 256 gb varient at around 20k. A must buy for Samsung fans."

Best product for normal day-to-day usage with a bigger battery, great display, and good camera setup. One UI, as usual, is working great."
37,Takes too much time to charge,3,"Purchased in prime day sale. Everything is fine. As Charger has not been provided by Samsung, So, I am charging it with the my old device Charger, which is 33W type A-C. It takes three hours to reach from 10 % to 100%.
